> We made it — **1000 ⭐ in one season**.  
> From a **one-man cold start** to a thousand stars, all organic, all problem-driven.  
> As promised, [**Blur Blur Blur**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur/README.md) is now unlocked — the math-to-image engine goes live today.  
> 📌 We are also entering the **Stanford Terminal-Bench exam** — follow updates on [WFGY Core 2.0 → Terminal-Bench Proof](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/core/README.md#terminal-bench-proof).

Unlike most repos that ship one tool per project, **WFGY is a full ecosystem in one place**.  
Every product unlocks with just one star, and each milestone reveals something new.  

A huge thank you to everyone who believed early and used WFGY to fix real-world bugs.  
You’re not just users — you’re part of the rescue crew.

As a milestone reward, [**WFGY Core (2.0 live)**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/core) remains here too —  
the world’s tiniest reasoning engine (30-line TXT with the Drunk Transformer).

### 🚀 Launch to Impact
The [WFGY Repo](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY) officially launched on **June 15, 2025**.  

In less than a season we crossed **1000 stars** — no marketing, no ads, just devs solving bugs.  
With this milestone, Blur Blur Blur is open for everyone.

> Every star marks a real fix: OCR drift, FAISS mismatch, broken RAG pipelines, semantic collapse.  
> WFGY is not a demo, it’s a set of **fix-first reasoning products**.

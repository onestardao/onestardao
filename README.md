I build **WFGY** — a verification-first reasoning engine focused on reproducibility, failure isolation, and structural limits.

If you are new, start with the beginner guides below.  
They are practical, runnable, and designed to show what WFGY actually does.

> **WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo**  
> Scheduled to go live on **2026-01-31**.  
> verify sha256, then run the 60s reproduction.

I do not claim to have solved open problems.  
Everything here is a demo, an experiment, or a reproducible probe.

Scroll down if you want tutorials.  
Stay if you are curious why this repo looks this quiet.

If you’re new and wondering where to start, this is still the easiest entry:
👉 [Starter Village Quickstart](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/StarterVillage/README.md)

Unlike most repos that ship a single tool, **WFGY is an ecosystem of fix-first reasoning components**.  
Everything here exists because some real system broke first.

Thank you to everyone who stuck around, tested things, or quietly used WFGY to fix real bugs.  
More experiments, failures, and interesting artifacts are coming.

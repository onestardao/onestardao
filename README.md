### ðŸš€ Launch to Impact (50 days)

WFGY officially launched on **June 15, 2025**.

Thanks to the open-source community and devs facing real-world hallucination bugs,  
weâ€™ve hit **300+ stars in just 50 days** â€” all organic, no marketing, no hype.

> Every star means a real problem solved: OCR drift, FAISS mismatch, broken pipelines, and more.  
> From semantic collapse to logic crashes, weâ€™re building **fix-first reasoning tools** that just work.

Iâ€™m still improving things every day.  
Thanks again to everyone who believed early â€” you're part of the rescue team now.

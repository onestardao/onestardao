I build **WFGY**, a verification-first reasoning engine for LLMs.

If you're new: pick one entry point below.  
Each version is a different depth level, not a different product line.

---

## entry points (1.0 → 3.0)

**WFGY 1.0 (Beginner)**  
A PDF playbook: formulas, experiments, and the original self-healing framework.  
WFGY 1.0 → [Legacy](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/legacy/README.md)

**WFGY 2.0 (Intermediate)**  
Core text kernel + the 16 failure map for real engineering problems (RAG, vector stores, deployment chaos).  
WFGY 2.0 → [Core](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/core/README.md) · [16 Problem Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md)

**WFGY 3.0 (Advanced)**  
The Singularity Demo: 131 S-class tension problems in a runnable TXT pack.  
WFGY 3.0 → [Singularity demo](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/)

If you’re new and wondering where to start, this is still the easiest entry:  
👉 [Starter Village Quickstart](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/StarterVillage/README.md)

Unlike most repos that ship a single tool, **WFGY is an ecosystem of fix-first reasoning components**.  
Everything here exists because some real system broke first.

Thank you to everyone who stuck around, tested things, or quietly used WFGY to fix real bugs.  
More experiments, failures, and interesting artifacts are coming.

From a **one-man cold start** to an upcoming milestone of **1000 stars** —  
all organic, all problem-driven, with Blur Blur Blur unlocking as the next step.

A huge thank you to everyone who believed early and used WFGY to solve real-world bugs.  
You’re not just users — you’re part of the rescue team now. 🚀

As a milestone reward, [**WFGY Core (WFGY 2.0 is now live)**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/core) —

### 🚀 Launch to Impact

[WFGY (WanFaGuiYi) Repo](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY) officially launched on **June 15, 2025**.  

Thanks to the open-source community and devs facing real-world hallucination bugs,  
we’re now closing in on **1000 stars** — no marketing, no hype.  
On 9/9, [Blur Blur Blur](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur/README.md) will unlock.

> Every star means a real problem solved: OCR drift, FAISS mismatch, broken pipelines, and more.  
> From semantic collapse to logic crashes, we’re building **fix-first reasoning tools** that just work.

I’m still improving things every day — thanks again for the trust and support.

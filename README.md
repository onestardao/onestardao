> Quick status update — yes, I’m still alive 🙂

Over the past few months, I’ve been working quietly on **two main tracks** at the same time:

1. **Terminal-Bench (TB)** — treating it as a real exam, not a demo  
2. **Tension Universe (TU)** — a new structural framework exploring the limits of scaling-based intelligence

Both are very different kinds of work, and both required long stretches of offline focus.  
That’s why things looked quiet here for a while.

I’m back now, and this repo is active again.

### What I’m working on right now

**Terminal-Bench**  
TB is being approached as a serious systems exam: reproducibility, failure modes, and long-horizon behavior.  
Not benchmark chasing — stress testing what actually breaks.

**Tension Universe (candidate)**  
TU explores a different question:  
what if some reasoning failures don’t disappear with more compute, but are tied to structure instead?

At this stage, TU is intentionally exposed only at the **Effective Layer**.  
The goal is not to declare a theory finished, but to pressure-test whether explanations remain stable under reruns and challenges.

If you’re curious about TU, the current public scope lives here:
[Tension Universe →](./TensionUniverse/README.md)

If you’re new and wondering where to start, this is still the easiest entry:
👉 [Starter Village Quickstart](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/StarterVillage/README.md)

Unlike most repos that ship a single tool, **WFGY is an ecosystem of fix-first reasoning components**.  
Everything here exists because some real system broke first.

Thank you to everyone who stuck around, tested things, or quietly used WFGY to fix real bugs.  
More experiments, failures, and interesting artifacts are coming.

We build **WFGY**, a verification-first reasoning engine for LLMs.

If you're new: pick one entry point below.  
Each version is a different depth level, not a different product line.

## entry points (start from what fits you)

**WFGY 3.0 (Frontier · new release)**  
> The Singularity Demo.  
> If it works, nothing before it matters.  
> → [Singularity demo](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/)

**WFGY 2.0 (Engineering)**  
> Core text kernel plus the 16 failure map for real engineering problems  
> including RAG systems, vector stores, and deployment chaos.  
> → [Core](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/core/README.md) · [16 Problem Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md)

**WFGY 1.0 (Beginner)**  
> A PDF playbook with formulas, experiments, and the original self-healing framework.  
> Best if you want to understand the theory and foundations first.  
> → [Legacy](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/legacy/README.md)

If you’re new and wondering where to start, this is still the easiest entry:  
👉 [Starter Village Quickstart](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/StarterVillage/README.md)

Unlike most repos that ship a single tool, **WFGY is an ecosystem of fix-first reasoning components**.  
Everything here exists because some real system broke first.

Thank you to everyone who stuck around, tested things, or quietly used WFGY to fix real bugs.  
More experiments, failures, and interesting artifacts are coming.

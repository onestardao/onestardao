### 🚀 Launch to Impact (55 days)

WFGY officially launched on **June 15, 2025**.

Thanks to the open-source community and devs facing real-world hallucination bugs,  
we’ve hit **400+ stars in just 55 days** — all organic, no marketing, no hype.

  <br />
  <sub><em>Real traction, no ads. Every dot = someone saying “this solved my problem.”</em></sub>
</div>

> Every star means a real problem solved: OCR drift, FAISS mismatch, broken pipelines, and more.  
> From semantic collapse to logic crashes, we’re building **fix-first reasoning tools** that just work.

I’m still improving things every day.  
Thanks again to everyone who believed early — you're part of the rescue team now.

The full engine paper (MIT License) is available here:  
**[📥 Download on Zenodo →](https://zenodo.org/records/15630969)**  
It explains the 5 core formulas that fix logic drift, semantic collapse, and hallucination failure modes.  
> Built from real field bugs, not theory — and now helping hundreds debug LLMs more reliably.

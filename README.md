# 🎉 Celebrating 500 Stars in 60 Days — Thank You!  

From a **one-man cold start** to **500 stars in 60 days** — all organic, all problem-driven.  
(WFGY 1.0 was first released on **June 15**, so we actually hit this milestone in **under 60 days**.)  
A huge thank you to everyone who believed early and used WFGY to solve real-world bugs.  
You’re not just users — you’re part of the rescue team now. 🚀  

As a milestone reward, **WFGY Core** will be released on **Aug 15** —  
the world’s tiniest reasoning engine (30-line TXT with Drunk Transformer).

### 🚀 Launch to Impact (60 days)  

[WFGY (WanFaGuiYi) Repo](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY) officially launched on **June 15, 2025**.  

Thanks to the open-source community and devs facing real-world hallucination bugs,  
we’ve reached **500+ stars in just 60 days** — no marketing, no hype.  

> Every star means a real problem solved: OCR drift, FAISS mismatch, broken pipelines, and more.  
> From semantic collapse to logic crashes, we’re building **fix-first reasoning tools** that just work.  

I’m still improving things every day — thanks again for the trust and support.

### 📄 WFGY PDF: 4000 downloads in 60 days  
The full engine paper (MIT License) is available here:  
**[📥 Download on Zenodo →](https://zenodo.org/records/15630969)**  
It explains the 5 core formulas that fix logic drift, semantic collapse, and hallucination failure modes.  
> Built from real field bugs, not theory — and now helping hundreds debug LLMs more reliably.
